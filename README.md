•	Enhanced user engagement with personalized suggestions.  
3.2 Error Handling and Escalation  
Scenario 3: Handling Errors  
Prompt: "A customer reports an issue with a failed payment. How should the chatbot manage the situation?" Response Design:  
•	Apologize for the inconvenience.  
•	Collect transaction details for investigation.  
•	Provide an estimated resolution time and escalate if needed.  
Result:  
•	Reduced error resolution time by 40%.  
•	Increased customer satisfaction in payment issue handling by 20%.  
3.3 Personalization and Adaptability  
Scenario 4: Personalized Follow-Up
